# BasicCalculator
BasicCalculator in C++

BrainStorming Version .1 CalCalculator

# Functions needed in a calculator
Add, Subtract, Multiple, Divide, history(able to chose the last number to continue work)

# Layout of the Calc
For terminal, able to enter all # and then hit enter to enter that number 

# Layout of code
Calculator class with add,sub etc functions, main function calls the class which has a declarator? That should call a run function, if user wants to quit then quit

Within this run function we would call the help functions based on what the user wants, this way everything should be better organized. 

# Unit testing
After first design of the CalCalculator, have unit tests in place to make sure that the calculator gets the results that you want, think of every possible edge case
